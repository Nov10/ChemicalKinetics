# ChemicalKinetics
 Chemical Kinetics with Python

This repository performs simulations of chemical equilibrium based on chemical kinetics. It is based on high school level chemical theories and calculates the equilibrium state of chemical reactions through numerical methods. It can calculate Le Chatelier's principle with changes in temperature, pressure, and concentration.
